# Objective

The main objective of this project is to study and implement the use of NumPy in Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). This project aims to develop a clear understanding of how NumPy arrays are created, manipulated, and analyzed. It also focuses on performing mathematical and statistical operations efficiently using NumPy. Through this implementation, the goal is to understand how numerical data can be handled effectively in Python for analysis purposes.

## Theory

NumPy (Numerical Python) is one of the most important libraries in Python for numerical and scientific computing. It provides support for multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

In Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data needs to be examined, summarized, and manipulated before applying further techniques. NumPy plays a crucial role in this process because it allows fast and efficient numerical computations. Unlike Python lists, NumPy arrays are more memory-efficient and provide better performance due to their optimized internal structure.

Key concepts involved in this project include:

Creation of one-dimensional and multi-dimensional arrays

Indexing and slicing of arrays

Performing element-wise arithmetic operations

Applying mathematical functions such as sum, minimum, maximum, etc.

Calculating statistical measures like mean, median, variance, and standard deviation

Reshaping and transforming arrays for better data organization

NumPy also supports vectorized operations, which means operations can be performed on entire arrays without the need for explicit loops. This significantly improves computational speed and makes data analysis more efficient.

Thus, NumPy forms the foundation for advanced data analysis libraries such as Pandas, SciPy, and machine learning frameworks.



## Conclusion
In this project, the practical implementation of NumPy for Exploratory Data Analysis was successfully carried out. Various operations such as array creation, indexing, reshaping, and statistical calculations were performed to understand the working of NumPy.

The project helped in understanding how numerical data can be efficiently stored and processed using NumPy arrays. It also demonstrated the advantages of NumPy over traditional Python lists in terms of speed and performance. Overall, this experiment strengthened the fundamental knowledge of numerical computing in Python and provided a strong base for further studies in data analysis and machine learning.
